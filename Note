LA Homeless Project Report
Interactive Homeless Operations Planner and Tracker: Los Angeles County


Objective:
reduce unsheltered by 50% in five years
track concentration of homeless over time
identify critical areas to prioritize funding and other resources
know service need


Solution design:
a measure to estimate homeless density
a measure to estimate health and safety tisk
(prioritize areas: unsheltered homelessness, public safety incident, community complaints, danger and health risk of homeless community)
online mapping application(density, numbers)
exsisting and potential resources located
analysis and recommendations


Data: LA city+public data
●	311 Homeless Encampments Requests
●	Crime and Homeless Victim
●	Homeless Count Results by Census Tract
●	Homeless Shelters and Services
●	Homeless_Count_2017_Results_CD 
●	Stores Data, Weather, flood and other diasters

Tools:
●	Tableau
●	R (ggmap; shinyr; leaflet)
●	Excel

Factors:
health
safety risks: natural factors(disaster:center around natural, weather and temperature);human factors(311call,crime)
density
resources

Data collection：

Data cleaning:
variable selection
remove missing value, replace N/A
merge data(counties and blocks info) from disparate sources, automation
add new variables: violent crime

Metrics:
vulnerbility score including risk and health (crime%, 311 call%, homeless%, unseltered ratio, 
number of pending and open encampment request

Make assumptions

Analysis:
time-based descriptive analysis
predictive analysis
geospacial analysis
risk score that is adjustable

Visualization: bar, stacked bar, line, density, heat map, polygon graph
●	311 Homeless Encampments Requests
time series patterns: increasing, weekday high (operation)
check status:not efficient
density: LA not efficient
●	Crime and Homeless Victim
time series patterns: June, July temperature; weekend evening
crime type, age(old,young)
density: Burbank, dt LA
●	Homeless Count Results by Census Tract
●	Homeless Shelters and Services
comparision bt homeless and shelters (density not consistent)
●	Homeless_Count_2017_Results_CD 

●	Stores Data


Solution:
natural factors:score
human factors: interative mapping application (https://siyao.shinyapps.io/lacityvis/)
Shiny R dashborad(mapping preference, customerization: type, zoom..) (https://siyao.shinyapps.io/lacityvis2/)
KPI, Slider to adjust weight, plot, map, table

Recommendation:
short-term
efficency of processing encampment request
collaboration with stores(no sherlter but store)
homeless migration because of disaster
long-term
ID number with resources, registration: trace migrating, act in time (free haircut)


Learnt:
exclude outliers(large value), then density graph
